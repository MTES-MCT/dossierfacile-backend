# Asynchronous Task Management Service (dossierfacile-task-scheduler)

## Description

The **dossierfacile-task-scheduler** service is a key component of our system, dedicated to executing scheduled and
recurring tasks. It is based on the **Spring Boot** framework and uses the `@Scheduled` annotation to define and manage
the execution frequency.

Tasks are configured in two ways:

- **Either periodically**: using a fixed duration between each execution (`fixedRate` or `fixedDelay`).
- **Or based on a Cron expression**: allowing specific moments in time to be defined (e.g., "every day at 3 AM" or "the
  first day of each month at midnight").

This service allows periodic asynchronous operations that could negatively impact the performance of applications
requiring high availability if they were performed on those services.

Furthermore, it also allows critical services to be scaled horizontally, thus ensuring efficient management of
increasing loads and activity peaks.

## Tasks:
